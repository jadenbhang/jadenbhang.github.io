        <h2 class="mainstory">Verstappen's Dominance</h2>
          <p>The 2025 F1 season has been a rollercoaster of surprises, but Max Verstappen’s masterful drive at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix reaffirmed his status as the sport’s dominant force. Despite McLaren’s early-season supremacy, Verstappen executed a breathtaking overtake on Oscar Piastri and George Russell to claim his 65th career victory—a reminder of his relentless racecraft. The win was particularly sweet for Red Bull, marking their 400th Grand Prix start and silencing doubts about their competitiveness after a rocky start to the year.</p>
          <p>Red Bull’s Imola upgrades played a pivotal role in Verstappen’s success. While the updates didn’t outright boost the car’s peak speed, they significantly improved the RB21’s balance and tire management, widening its operational window. Insiders revealed Verstappen was “happier with the car than he has been for a while,” a critical shift after early-season struggles. The new floor, introduced in Miami and refined at Imola, allowed Verstappen to exploit the car’s potential, even under safety car restarts where he effortlessly rebuilt his lead.</p>

          <p>The victory also intensified the championship narrative. Verstappen now sits third in the standings (124 points), trailing McLaren’s Oscar Piastri (146) and Lando Norris (133). However, rumors swirl about a clause in his Red Bull contract that could allow him to leave if he’s outside the top two by the summer break. With Mercedes and Aston Martin lurking, Red Bull’s ability to sustain this resurgence could determine whether Verstappen stays or seeks greener pastures.</p>
          <p>McLaren, meanwhile, faces internal tensions. Piastri’s early lead has thrust him into the spotlight, but Norris’ consistency keeps him in contention. The team’s Constructors’ Championship lead (279 points) masks a brewing rivalry: if Piastri maintains his edge, will McLaren prioritize him over Norris? Their dynamic echoes Red Bull’s past dilemmas, where intra-team battles often decided titles.</p>

         <p>Ferrari’s struggles contrast sharply with Red Bull’s revival. Lewis Hamilton’s transition to the Scuderia has been fraught with challenges, including a dismal P7 finish in Saudi Arabia, 30 seconds behind teammate Charles Leclerc. Ralf Schumacher speculates Hamilton could retire if his form doesn’t improve, citing the mental toll of underperforming. Meanwhile, Leclerc’s Monaco victory last year remains a rare bright spot for the team, now grappling with inconsistency.</p>
          <p>Further down the grid, Williams emerges as a dark horse. With Carlos Sainz joining Alex Albon, the team has capitalized on rivals’ rookie lineups and its own aerodynamic tweaks. James Vowles’ leadership has transformed Williams into a podium contender, a stark turnaround from their backmarker status. Their progress underscores how midfield teams can disrupt the established order in F1’s tightest-ever competitive era.</p>

          <p>As the circus heads to Monaco, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Verstappen’s resurgence, McLaren’s internal duel, and Hamilton’s Ferrari woes are just subplots in a season where every point matters. With the field closer than ever, 2025 is proving that even in a sport dominated by technology, human drama still steals the show.</p>
